Left Side = Traditional | Right Side = Modern

**1: BIOLOGICAL BASIS**

Evolutionary theory offers insights into why certain gender differences may exist, particularly those related to reproductive roles. 

Ex: it explains why men may be more likely to engage in risk-taking behavior (as a result of historical roles in hunting or competition for mates) and why women may show greater tendencies toward nurturing and cooperation (due to child-rearing responsibilities).

**2: SEXUAL BASIS**

Evolutionary theory explains certain patterns in mate preferences.

Ex: traits like physical strength or attractiveness in men and nurturing qualities in women may historically have been selected for reproductive success. However, in modern times, these preferences are shifting, with increasing emphasis on emotional compatibility, shared interests, and equality.

**3: THE EVOLUTION OF “EVOLUTION”**

Evolution:
Survival -> Genetic Mutation -> Development -> Response to Environmental Pressure
1. Environment
Males = Expected to be strong and handy; local men often do construction or heavy yard work.
Females = Expected to be nurturing; local women are usually seen taking care of kids at home.

2. Cultural Norms
Males = Expected to be family providers; men are usually the ones with jobs.
Females = Expected to manage the home; women are often seen cooking or cleaning.

3. Social Relationships
Males = Expected to lead; men in friend groups often take charge of planning events.
Females = Expected to be emotional supporters; women are seen comforting friends during tough times.

4. Media
Males = Expected to be tough; movies show men as action heroes saving the day.
Females = Expected to look pretty; TV shows portray women focusing on fashion and beauty.

Gender Fluidity = gender is not fixed or binary but can be flexible, shifting across a spectrum (no stereotypes)
-> opposite of gender rigidity

ADVANTAGES
- Knowledge 101 = explain the origins of gender roles and behaviors (that we can use as a basis on how to improve as a society)
- Challenging Stereotypes = acknowledgment of gender spectrum (extended relatives in family, friend, asexuals)s; to conform outside expectations
- Hmm. Determinism?  (Biological Determinism)= “gender roles are fixed and predetermined”? We don’t think so. (culture & choice > biology only)

DISADVANTAGES
- Misinterpret 404 = despite knowledge, some may misuse this information to justify existing inequalities (“natural” > socially constructed)
- Promoting Stereotypes = non-traditional identities as abnormal (since kalaunan lang naman nag-boom ang concept; mahina pa ang normalization)
- Oversimplified = are we confined in Biological and Social Evolution? (How about Personal Agency? passion? whim? advocacies? mental health)
  
    ex: Woman -> Engineering > Nursing (because it’s her ambition)
  
      Insides = Choice is restricted to biology & physiology
      Outsides = Choice is more on society’s expectations
      Other Factors = spiritual, political, legal
